                <hr class="dark">
                <p class="text-dark">ProductCamp is a free, user-driven, collaborative "unconference" for Product Managers and anyone involved in building products. The concept was founded in Silicon Valley in 2008 by Rich Moronov. ProductCamp has since been brought to major cities across the world by local product communities.</p>
                <p class="text-dark">Being a Product Manager is hard and it's not typically easy to get the coaching or training needed for the job. The “unconference” format will give you the opportunity to learn, share and network with peers in a way that is completely unique and collaborative. It's the ultimate "safe space" to try out something new, discuss ideas and grow and develop as a Product Manager.</p>
